# Code README

This README provides an overview of the code in the  `main.go`  file and explains its functionality.

## Description

The code in  `main.go`  is a Go program that retrieves data from a specified URL and parses it as JSON. It demonstrates how to make an HTTP GET request, handle the response, and parse JSON data into a struct.

## Dependencies

This code requires the following dependencies:

- Go standard library

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:
go run main.go <url>
Replace  `<url>`  with the URL from which you want to retrieve JSON data.

## Functionality

1. The program accepts a command-line argument as the URL to fetch JSON data from.
2. It validates the URL format and displays an error message if it is invalid.
3. It makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.
4. If the response status code is not 200 (OK), it displays an error message along with the response body.
5. It reads the response body and parses it as JSON.
6. It populates a  `People`  struct with the parsed data.
7. It prints the parsed data, including the name, height, and films associated with the person.

## Struct

The code defines a  `People`  struct with the following fields:

-  `Name`  (string): The name of the person.
-  `Height`  (string): The height of the person.
-  `Film`  ([]string): A slice of strings representing the films associated with the person.

## Error Handling

The code utilizes error handling to handle potential errors during the execution of the program. If an error occurs, it logs the error and exits the program.

## Limitations

- The code assumes that the provided URL is valid and points to a JSON resource.
- It only handles JSON responses with a status code of 200 (OK). Other status codes are considered invalid.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code to fit your specific requirements.
